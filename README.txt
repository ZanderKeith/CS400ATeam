Other notes or comments to the grader:
    The jar file was made for Windows 10.
    On mac os, there is a chance that the home image does not display, although we believe we fixed this issue for some mac computers.  

Known Bugs:
    1. executable.jar does not run on mac OS. It is unknown if the jar file works on Linux.
       On Windows 10, working command is 
       java --module-path "Your local path to \javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar executable.jar
    2. Reports sort weights and percentages lexographically instead of numerically.

Planned:
    1. Implementing "All" funcitonality on Annual and Monthly Report 
    2. Enable user to cancel overwriting the existing data. Currently the data for the same date gets overwritten.
    3. Enable user to delete specific data. Currently the user can only remove a farm completely.
